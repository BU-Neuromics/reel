"""HTTP endpoint for the Aperture-Exon conversational contract (design.md
Decision 8's wire contract). Slice 3 of 3 -- see conversational_planner.py's
docstring for the full split.

This is a thin wrapper: it translates Decision 8's JSON request/response
shape to and from conversational_orchestrator.append_turn/edit_turn calls.
It has no planning logic and no turn-list bookkeeping of its own -- both
already exist and are already tested in isolation.

Capabilities are supplied at app-construction time (`create_conversational_app
(capabilities, ...)`), mirroring how `mosaic.mcp.server.create_mcp_server`
takes its schema-derived data as a constructor argument rather than
fetching it itself. That keeps the app itself testable with a plain dict.

`main()` (below) is the deployment entry point that supplies it for real:
`python -m exon.conversational_server` fetches `mosaic://capabilities` from
Mosaic once at startup via `mosaic_mcp.fetch_capabilities()` and serves the
app -- design.md Decision 8's own "Exon's own turn endpoint may call ...
mosaic://capabilities as an MCP client", now that
`add-mosaic-mcp-boundary` task 2.3 has supplied that client.

This is the process Mosaic's `converse_query_spec` tool talks to: point
Mosaic's `MOSAIC_REEL_URL` at this server's `/turn`.
