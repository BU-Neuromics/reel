"""Exon's MCP client onto Mosaic's query boundary (`add-mosaic-mcp-boundary`
task 2.3).

This is the module that makes Exon a *client* of the boundary rather than a
second implementation of it. Three calls, each replacing something Exon used
to do locally:

  - `fetch_capabilities()`  replaces `schema.load_capability_manifest()` reading
    a hand-authored `evals/schema/capabilities.json`. The server generates the
    manifest from its own live `SchemaRegistry`, so it cannot drift from the
    deployment the query will actually run against -- which was the whole
    three-way-drift problem this migration exists to fix.
  - `validate_query_spec()` replaces `validator.validate_plan()`.
  - `execute_query_spec()`  replaces `executor.execute_plan()`.

Deliberately NOT included:

  - Any re-implementation of validation. A `valid: false` result is returned
    as-is, coded errors and all; interpreting them is the caller's business.
    Re-checking anything here would rebuild the duplication being removed.
  - The aggregation/search tools (`count_query_spec` etc.). They exist on the
    boundary and Exon will need them, but *deciding* which of them a given
    instruction wants is task 2.5c's open question ("teach the planner to
    route, or grade the class explicitly") -- an unmade decision, not a
    missing function. Wiring them in ahead of that choice would prejudge it,
    so this module exposes only what task 2.3 actually asks for. Adding them
    later is additive: same session plumbing, one more thin method each.

Sync-facing on purpose. The MCP SDK is async, but every caller here (`cli.py`,
the harness) is synchronous top-to-bottom, and one `asyncio.run` per call is
the honest cost of that -- there is no long-lived session to amortize, since
each Exon invocation is a one-shot process. A future long-running Exon service
would want a persistent session instead; that is a real change, flagged here
rather than pre-built.
