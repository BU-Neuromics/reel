"""Schema-grounded LLM query planner: NL instruction -> typed QuerySpec (dict).

The QuerySpec-emitting counterpart to planner.py's QueryPlan emitter, added alongside it
(not replacing it) so the harness can grade both shapes against the same cases and prove
equivalence before anything is retired -- see openspec/changes/add-mosaic-mcp-boundary
tasks 2.2-2.7.

Three deliberate differences from planner.py, each a consequence of Mosaic now owning the
query boundary (ADR-0009):

1. **Emits a plain dict, never local dataclasses.** Exon does not re-model QuerySpec in
   Python. Re-modeling it would recreate exactly the three-way duplication this migration
   exists to remove -- the artifact goes straight to Mosaic's `validate_query_spec`, which
   is the authoritative parser and validator. `exon/ops.py`'s local op dataclasses are what
   this replaces, not something to reimplement in a new spelling.

2. **Grounding comes from `mosaic://capabilities`, which the server generates.** planner.py
   grounds partly in `evals/schema/capabilities.json`, a hand-authored exploration log of
   this deployment's observed behavior. The manifest now carries per-field legal `filter_ops`,
   a `predicate` flag marking which references can be traversed, and `enum_values` -- so the
   model can be told which ops are legal on which field *before* it guesses, rather than
   being corrected by a validation error afterward.

3. **No multi-step plan, no client_filter.** QueryPlan's `source_step` chaining and
   client-side `client_filter` existed because Mosaic had no server-side relationship
   predicate (mosaic#148). It does now, so what took two chained steps plus a client-side
   narrowing collapses into one QuerySpec with a `RelatedCondition`.

Op vocabulary is restricted to `FieldCondition` and `RelatedCondition` -- no `CriteriaGroup`
nesting -- matching add-exon-conversational-contract's Non-Goals. Mosaic's validator accepts
nested groups to depth 3; this emitter simply never produces them, keeping the tool schema
flat and legible to the model. Growing into groups later is additive on both sides.
