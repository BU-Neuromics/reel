"""Turn-list state management for the Aperture-Exon conversational contract
(design.md Decision 5: rewind-and-edit with recompute-and-suspend).

Slice 2 of 3 (see conversational_planner.py's own docstring for the split):
this module owns the `list[Turn]` a conversation accumulates -- assigning
turn ids, deciding what "the current draft" is, and recomputing/suspending
turns after an edit. It has no network surface either; the HTTP endpoint
(Decision 8) is slice 3, a thin wrapper calling `append_turn`/`edit_turn`.

Two judgment calls made here, stated explicitly because neither is handed
down by design.md in this much detail:

1. **What "no longer makes sense" (Decision 5) means, mechanically.** No
   heuristic is invented beyond what request_turn already tells us: an old
   turn is recomputed by re-running its ORIGINAL utterance against the new
   state, and it is marked `suspended` exactly when that recompute comes
   back `status="clarification"` -- i.e. the model itself can no longer
   confidently resolve it. That clarification's own message becomes the
   suspended turn's message, since Decision 5 already says a suspended turn
   is "surfaced to the user to re-prompt" -- the model's own question IS
   the re-prompt, not a separately synthesized one.

2. **A genuine call failure is never folded into "suspended."** Ambiguity
   (`status="clarification"`) is a SUCCESSFUL call -- the model did its job
   and reported it can't resolve this. An API error or exhausted parse
   retries is a system failure, unrelated to conversational ambiguity, and
   is raised loudly (matches spec_planner.plan_query_spec's own
   RuntimeError convention) rather than silently presented to the user as
   "this turn is suspended," which would hide an operational problem behind
   a normal-looking conversational outcome.

Once a turn is marked suspended, everything after it cascades to suspended
without further model calls -- there is no coherent base state left to
reinterpret them against once the chain of drafts breaks.
