# ADR-0002: Data-story reproducibility via one as-of watermark per story-version

## Context

A data story is a narrative artifact people share, revisit, and cite. **It must tell the same
story whenever it is rerun** — a story composed today should reproduce identically next month —
*unless the user explicitly asks to pull in new data*. But the story's instructions query
**live Mosaic**, whose graph grows over time (new ingestions, supersessions). Naïve replay
("re-run the queries") would silently change artifacts as data lands, destroying reproducibility
and trust. This is the one way the parametric-CAD analogy breaks: CAD recompute is deterministic;
querying a moving database is not.

Mosaic already provides the substrate: no hard deletes; an append-only provenance log with
`state_snapshot` + `previous_state_hash`; per-entity as-of reconstruction (`client.state_at`);
and `schema_version` derived from the provenance log (so the *type system* as-of T is recoverable
too).

## Decision

**A `DataStory` carries exactly one as-of watermark (a timestamp), and every query in the story
resolves against the graph as it stood at that watermark.** Replay re-evaluates the instructions'
typed ops as-of T, so it is deterministic and the story reproduces identically regardless of when
it runs.

**"Pull in new data" is never a silent refresh.** It is an explicit instruction that produces a
**new story-version at a new watermark** (replaying the path against the new T) and is itself a
recorded, rewindable provenance event. One watermark per story-version — a single story never
mixes data from multiple times.

To make recompute-on-edit efficient and to mirror Mosaic's own design, **instruction nodes are
content-addressed**: a node's identity is `hash(op, parent-hashes, watermark)`, so editing an
instruction recomputes only reachable descendants whose hash changed; unchanged branches are
reused (the same idea as Mosaic's `previous_state_hash`).

## Consequences

- Reproducibility is a property of the data model, not of operator discipline: rewind/replay
  shows *what you saw then*, materialized artifacts are data-version-stamped, and "refresh against
  current data" is an explicit, audited action.
- **Forces State to stay intensional** (ADR-0001): you can only replay-as-of-T if the State is a
  spec re-evaluated against the graph, not a frozen bag of objects.
- **Depends on a Mosaic platform capability: graph-level / query-spanning as-of** — "evaluate this
  whole subgraph query as the graph stood at T," resolving every entity, relationship, and schema
  version to T, over the transport Reel uses. Mosaic today exposes this only **per entity**
  (`state_at`) and not on the GraphQL surface (equality-filter + additive-only). The substrate
  exists in the provenance log; the query-spanning resolver is a build (filed as Mosaic ADR-0001 /
  graph-level as-of). This extends the `vision.md` invariant to "typed, introspectable,
  dry-run-validatable, provenance-tracked — **and time-travelable**."
- Content-addressing gives free memoized recompute and aligns the instruction graph with the
  provenance graph.

## Alternatives considered

- **Always re-execute against current data on replay.** Simplest to implement; destroys
  reproducibility (the story changes under you). Rejected — this is the failure mode the whole
  ADR exists to prevent.
- **Snapshot the materialized results into the story** (extensional state). Reproducible, but
  stories balloon, can't be re-rooted/replayed, and lose the "re-runnable artifact" property.
  Rejected in favor of intensional state + as-of replay.
- **Per-instruction watermarks.** Would let one story mix data from many times — confusing and
  rarely desired. Rejected: one watermark per story-version; "pull new data" forks a new version.

## Notes / open sub-questions

- Depends on **Mosaic graph-level as-of query**, which is a Mosaic spec item (Mosaic ADR-0001);
  this ADR cannot be ratified until that capability is on Mosaic's roadmap.

### Status update (2026-09-11) — the Mosaic dependency is Accepted and partly built

- **Mosaic ADR-0001 (graph-level / query-spanning as-of) is `Accepted`** — ratified 2026-06-17,
  the same day this ADR was authored, so the "cannot be ratified until on Mosaic's roadmap"
  blocker above is cleared. Its design is Mosaic `sec6 §6.8`; implementation is staged in five
  increments and in progress (Mosaic `design/INDEX.md`).
- **What is live today:** `asOf` is an additive parameter on Mosaic's GraphQL reads and a field of
  the QuerySpec artifact (Aperture ADR-0035; Mosaic's `query_spec.py` validator accepts it) —
  with **one hard constraint**: `asOf` is **not combinable with a relationship predicate**
  (`RelatedCondition`) on the same query until Mosaic's temporal join ("M5a") lands. A v1 story
  whose path contains an `exists-related-filter` therefore cannot yet pin a watermark; the
  validator rejects the combination with a coded error rather than answering wrongly.
- **The prototype makes no reproducibility promise.** Exon's conversational contract
  (`mosaic-demo-small` `add-exon-conversational-contract/design.md`, Decision 6) re-runs anchor
  pivots "fresh against current data" and states the graph-level resolver gap as a non-goal.
  Watermark pinning per story-version is therefore the **first capability Reel adds** over the
  migrated prototype — see `../../proposals/exon-migration.md` (delta D2).
- **Content-addressed nodes are not in the prototype.** Exon's turn `id`s are opaque, not
  `hash(op, parent-hashes, watermark)`; this is a migration delta, not a contract change (the
  wire `id` stays opaque to callers).
